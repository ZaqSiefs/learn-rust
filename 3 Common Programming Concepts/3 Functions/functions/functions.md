# Functions

Functions are defined using ```fn```followed by the function name and a set of parentheses that store function arguments. The curly braces denote where the function begins and ends to the compiler

Functions are called using the function name and curly praces

## Parameters

Special variables that are a part of a functions signature.

You can provide the funtion with concrete values.

The type of each parameter must be declared in the function signature.

Multiple parameters in the signature are separated using commas

## Statements and Expressions

Statements: Instructions that perform some action and do not return a value, end with semicolon.

Expressions: Evaluate to a resultant value, do not end with semicolon.

## Functions with Return Values

Return values are not named, but their type must be declared after ```->```

The return value is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body function

```return``` returns from a function early

Most functions return the last expression implicitly
